In order theory, a \emph{nucleus} is a 
function $F$ on a meet-semilattice $\mathfrak{A}$ such that (for every $p$ in 
$\mathfrak{A}$):

\begin{enumerate}
\item $p \le F(p)$
\item $F(F(p)) = F(p)$
\item $F(p \wedge q) = F(p) \wedge F(q)$
\end{enumerate}

Usually, the term \emph{nucleus}} is used in frames and locales theory (when the 
semilattice $\mathfrak{A}$ is a frame).

\section{Some well known results about nuclei}

\textbf{Proposition} If $F$ is a nucleus on a frame $\mathfrak{A}$, then the poset 
$\operatorname{Fix}(F)$ of fixed points of $F$, with order inherited from 
$\mathfrak{A}$, is also a frame.
