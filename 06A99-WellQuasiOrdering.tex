\begin{document}
Let $Q$ be a set and $\precsim$ a quasi-order on $Q$.  An
infinite sequence in $Q$ is referred to as \emph{bad} if for
all $i<j \in \NN$, $a_i \not\precsim a_j$ holds; otherwise it is called
\emph{good}. Note that an antichain is obviously a bad sequence. 

A quasi-ordering $\precsim$ on $Q$ is a \emph{well-quasi-ordering} (\emph{wqo}) if for every infinite sequence is good.  Every well-ordering is a well-quasi-ordering.

The following proposition gives equivalent definitions for
well-quasi-ordering:
\begin{prop}
Given a set $Q$ and a binary relation $\precsim$ over $Q$, the
following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(Q, \precsim)$ is a well-quasi-ordering;
  \item $(Q, \precsim)$ has no infinite ($\omega$-) strictly decreasing chains
and no infinite antichains.
  \item Every linear extension of $Q/_\approx$ is a well-order, where $\approx$ is the equivalence relation and $Q/_\approx$ is the set of equivalence classes induced by $\approx$.
  \item Any infinite ($\omega$-) $Q$-sequence contains an
increasing chain.
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}

The equivalence of WQO to the second and the fourth conditions is proved by the infinite version of Ramsey's theorem.
