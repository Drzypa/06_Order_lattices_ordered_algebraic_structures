\begin{document}
A \emph{latticoid} is a set $L$ with two binary operations, the meet $\wedge$ and the join $\vee$ on $L$ satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (idempotence) $x\wedge x=x\vee x=x$ for any $x\in L$,
\item (commutativity) $x\wedge y=y\wedge x$ and $x\vee y=y\vee x$ for any $x,y\in L$, and
\item (absorption) $x\vee (y\wedge x)=x\wedge (y\vee x)=x$ for any $x,y\in L$.
\end{enumerate}

A latticoid is like a lattice without the associativity assumption, i.e., a lattice is a latticoid that is both meet associative and join associative.

If one of the binary operations is associative, say $\wedge$ is associative, we may define a latticoid as a poset as follows: $$x\le y\mbox{ iff }x\wedge y=x.$$
Clearly, $\le$ is reflexive, as $x\wedge x=x$.  If $x\le y$ and $y\le x$, then $x=x\wedge y=y\wedge x=y$, so $\le$ is anti-symmetric.  Finally, suppose $x\le y$ and $y\le z$, then $x\wedge z=(x\wedge y)\wedge z=x\wedge (y\wedge z)=x\wedge y=x$, or $x\le z$, $\le$ is transitive.

Once a latticoid is a poset, we may easily visualize it by a diagram (Hasse diagram), much like that of a lattice.  Position $y$ above $x$ if $x\le y$ and connect a line segment between $x$ and $y$.  The following is the diagram of a latticoid that is meet associative but not join associative:
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix{
& {a\vee b} \ar@{-}[d] & \\
& c \ar@{-}[ld] \ar@{-}[rd] & \\
a \ar@{-}[rd] & & b \ar@{-}[ld] \\
& {a\wedge b} &
}
\end{equation*}
It is not join associative because $(a\vee b)\vee c= a\vee b$, whereas $a\vee (b\vee c)=a\vee c=c\ne a\vee b$.

Given a latticoid $L$, we can define a dual $L^*$ of $L$ by using the same underlying set, and define the meet of $a$ and $b$ in $L^*$ as the join of $a$ and $b$ in $L$, and the join of $a$ and $b$ (in $L^*$) as the meet of $a$ and $b$ in $L$.  $L$ is a meet-associative latticoid iff $L^*$ is join-associative.
