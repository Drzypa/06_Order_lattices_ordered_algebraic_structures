\begin{thm}
Let $P$ be a poset of height $h$. Then $P$ can be partitioned into $h$ antichains and furthermore at least $h$ antichains are required.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Induction on $h$. If $h=1$, then no elements of $P$ are comparable, so $P$ is an antichain. Now suppose that $P$ has height $h\geq 2$ and that the theorem is true for $h-1$. Let $A_1$ be the set of maximal elements of $P$. Then $A_1$ is an antichain in $P$ and $P-A_1$ has height $h-1$ since we have removed precisely one element from every chain. Hence, $P-A_1$ can be paritioned into $h-1$ antichains $A_2,A_3,\dots A_h$. Now we have the partition $A_1\cup A_2\cup\dots\cup A_h$ of $P$ into $h$ antichains as desired.

The necessity of $h$ antichains is trivial by the pigeonhole principle; since $P$ has height $h$, it has a chain of length $h$, and each element of this chain must be placed in a different antichain of our partition.
\end{proof}
