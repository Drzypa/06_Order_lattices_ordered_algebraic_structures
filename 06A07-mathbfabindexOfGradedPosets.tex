\begin{document}
Let $P$ be a graded poset of rank $n+1$ 
with a $\hat{0}$ and a $\hat{1}$.
Let $\rho\colon P\to\mathbb{N}$ be the rank function of $P$.
The {\em $\mathbf{ab}$-index} of $P$ with coefficients in 
the ring $R$ is a noncommutative polynomial $\Psi(P)$ in
the free associative algebra 
$R\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle$ defined by the formula
\[
\Psi(P)=\sum_{c=\{\hat{0}=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_k=\hat{1}\}}w(c),
\]
with the weight of a chain $c$ defined by 
$w(c)=z_1\cdots z_n$, where
\[
z_i=\begin{cases}
\bbb,   & i\in\rho(x_0,\dots,x_k) \\
\aaa-\bbb, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]

Let us compute $\Psi$ in a simple example.  Let $P_n$ be the
face lattice of an $n$-gon.  Below we display $P_5$.
\[\xymatrix{
 &  & 
\hat{1}\ar@{-}[lld]\ar@{-}[ld]\ar@{-}[d]\ar@{-}[rd]\ar@{-}[rrd] &  &  \\
\{p,q\}\ar@{-}[d]\ar@{-}[rrrrd] & 
\{q,r\}\ar@{-}[ld]\ar@{-}[d] & 
\{r,s\}\ar@{-}[ld]\ar@{-}[d] & 
\{s,t\}\ar@{-}[ld]\ar@{-}[d] & 
\{t,u\}\ar@{-}[ld]\ar@{-}[d] \\
\{p\}\ar@{-}[rrd] & 
\{q\}\ar@{-}[rd] & 
\{r\}\ar@{-}[d] & 
\{s\}\ar@{-}[ld] & 
\{t\}\ar@{-}[lld] \\
 &  & \hat{0} &  & 
}\]
Thus $P_n$ has 
$n$ atoms, corresponding to vertices, and $n$ coatoms, corresponding
to edges.  Further, each vertex is incident with exactly two edges.
Let $c=\{\hat{0}=x_0<\cdots<x_k=\hat{1}\}$ be a chain in $P_n$.  There
are four possibilities.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$c=\{\hat{0} < \hat{1}\}$.  This chain does not include any elements
of ranks 1 or 2, so its weight is $(\aaa-\bbb)^2=\aaa^2-\aaa\bbb-\bbb\aaa+\bbb^2$.
\item
$c$ includes a vertex but not an edge.  This can happen in $n$ ways.
Each such chain has weight $\bbb(\aaa-\bbb)$.
\item
$c$ includes an edge but not a vertex. This can also happen in $n$ ways.
Each such chain has weight $(\aaa-\bbb)\bbb$.
\item
$c$ includes a vertex and an edge.  Since each vertex is incident with
exactly two edges, this can happen in $2n$ ways.  The weight of such a
chain is $b^2$.
\end{enumerate}
Summing over all the chains yields
\begin{align*}
\Psi(P)
&=\aaa^2+(n-1)\cdot\aaa\bbb+(n-1)\cdot\bbb\aaa+\bbb^2 \\
&=(\aaa+\bbb)^2+(n-2)\cdot(\aaa\bbb+\bbb\aaa).
\end{align*}
In this case the $\aaa\bbb$-index can be rewritten as a noncommutative
polynomial in the variables $\ccc=\aaa+\bbb$ and $\ddd=\aaa\bbb+\bbb\aaa$.
When this happens, we say that $P$ has a {\em $\ccc\ddd$-index}.  Thus 
the $\ccc\ddd$-index of the $n$-gon is $\ccc^2+(n-2)\cdot\ddd$.  Not
every graded poset has a $\ccc\ddd$-index.  However, every poset which 
arises
as the face lattice of a convex polytope, or more generally, every graded
poset which satisfies the generalized Dehn-Sommerville relations, has a $\ccc\ddd$-index.

An example of a poset whose $\aaa\bbb$-index cannot be written 
in terms of $\ccc$ and $\ddd$ is the boolean algebra $B_2$ with 
a new maximal element adjoined:
\[\xymatrix{
& \hat{1}\ar@{-}[d] & \\
& \{0,1\}\ar@{-}[ld]\ar@{-}[rd] & \\
\{0\}\ar@{-}[rd] & & \{1\}\ar@{-}[ld] \\
& \hat{0} &
}\]
The $\aaa\bbb$-index of this poset is $\aaa^2+\bbb\aaa$.
