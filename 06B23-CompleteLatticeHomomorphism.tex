\emph{Complete lattice homomorphism} is a function from one lattice to an other lattice, which preserves arbitrary (not only finite) meets and joins.

If $\phi:L \to M$ is lattice homomorphism between complete lattices $L$ and $M$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\phi(\bigvee \lbrace a_i\mid i\in I\rbrace) = \bigvee \lbrace \phi(a_i)\mid
i\in I\rbrace$, and
\item
$\phi(\bigwedge \lbrace a_i\mid i\in I\rbrace) = \bigwedge \lbrace
\phi(a_i)\mid i\in I\rbrace$,
\end{itemize}
then $\phi$ is called a \emph{complete lattice homomorphism}.

Most often are considered \emph{complete lattice homomorphisms} from one complete lattice to an other complete lattice (that is when all meets and joins are defined).

\emph{Complete lattice homomorphism} is a special case of lattice homomorphism.
