A \emph{filtrator} is a pair $(\mathfrak{A};\mathfrak{Z})$ consisting of a poset $\mathfrak{A}$ (the \emph{base} of the filtrator) and its subset $\mathfrak{Z}$ (the \emph{core} of the filtrator). The set $\mathfrak{Z}$ is considered as a poset with the induced order.

Having fixed a filtrator and an $a\in\mathfrak{A}$, we define:

$$\operatorname{up} a = \{ X\in\mathfrak{Z} | X \ge a \} \quad \operatorname{down} a = \{ X\in\mathfrak{Z} | X \le a \}.$$

Probably the most important example of a filtrator is a \emph{primary filtrator} that is the pair $(\mathfrak{F};\mathfrak{P})$ where $\mathfrak{F}$ is the set of filters on a poset ordered reverse to set-theoretic inclusion of filters and $\mathfrak{P}$ is the set of principal filters on this poset. For a filter $\mathcal{F}\in\mathfrak{F}$ we have $\operatorname{up}\mathcal{F}$ essentially equivalent with the set $\mathcal{F}$.
