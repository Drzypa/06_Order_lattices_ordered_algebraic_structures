\begin{document}
An element $z$ of lattice $L$ is \emph{pseudodifference} of $y$ and $x$ ($y\setminus x$) if $z$ is the least element such that $y\le x\cup z$.

\emph{Pseudodifference} is denoted either as $\setminus$ or as $-$. Sometimes \emph{pseudodifference} is denoted as $\setminus^*$.

The definition is borrowed from \PMlinkexternal{this online article}{http://www.hindawi.com/Getpdf.aspx?doi=10.1155/S0161171280000312}.
