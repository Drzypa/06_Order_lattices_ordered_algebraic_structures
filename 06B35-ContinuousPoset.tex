A poset $P$ is said to be \emph{continuous} if for every $a\in P$
\begin{enumerate}
\item the set $\operatorname{wb}(a)=\lbrace u\in P\mid u\ll a\rbrace$ is a directed set, 
\item $\bigvee \operatorname{wb}(a)$ exists, and
\item $a=\bigvee \operatorname{wb}(a)$.
\end{enumerate}
In the first condition, $\ll$ indicates the way below relation on $P$.  It is true that in \emph{any} poset, if $b:=\bigvee \operatorname{wb}(a)$ exists, then $b\le a$.  So for a poset to be continuous, we require that $a\le b$.

A \emph{continuous lattice} is a complete lattice whose underlying poset is continuous.  Note that if $P$ is a complete lattice, condition 1 above is automatically satisfied: suppose $u,v\ll a$ and $D\subseteq P$ with $a\le \bigvee D$, then there are finite subsets $F,G$ of $D$ with $u\le \bigvee F$ and $v\le \bigvee G$.  Then $H:=F\cup G\subseteq D$ is finite and $u\vee v\le \big(\bigvee F\big)\vee \big(\bigvee G\big)=\bigvee H$, or $u\vee v\ll a$, implying that $\operatorname{wb}(a)$ is directed.

\textbf{Examples}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any finite poset is continuous, and so is any finite lattice (since it is complete).  
\item A chain is continuous iff it is complete.  
\item The lattice of ideals of a ring is continuous.  
\item The set of all lower semicontinuous functions from a fixed compact topological space into the extended real numbers is a continuous lattice.
\item The set of all closed convex subsets of a compact convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ordered by reverse inclusion is a continuous lattice.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Remarks}.  
\begin{itemize}
\item
Every algebraic lattice is continuous.  
\item
Every continuous meet semilattice is meet continuous.
\end{itemize}
