\begin{document}
A sublattice $K$ of a complete lattice $L$ is a \emph{closed sublattice} of $L$ iff $K$ contains the meet and the join of any its nonempty subset.

Examples:

Any complete sublattice is a closed sublattice.

$[0;1]$ is a closed sublattice of $(-\infty;\infty)$.

The set of rational numbers is not a closed sublattice of the set of real numbers.
