\begin{prop} Let $L$ be a lattice with the least element $0$.  Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every pair of elements have a \PMlinkname{difference}{DifferenceOfLatticeElements}.
\item for any $a\in L$, the lattice interval $[0,a]$ is a complemented lattice.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose first that every pair of elements have a difference.  Let $b\in [0,a]$ and let $c$ be a difference between $a$ and $b$.  So $0=b\wedge c$ and $c\vee b=b\vee a=a$, since $b\le a$.  This shows that $c$ is a complement of $b$ in $[0,a]$.

Next suppose that $[0,a]$ is complemented for every $a\in L$.  Let $x,y\in L$ be any two elements in $L$.  Let $a=x\vee y$.  Since $[0,a]$ is complemented, $y$ has a complement, say $z\in [0,a]$.  This means that $y\wedge z=0$ and $y\vee z=a= x\vee y$.  Therefore, $z$ is a difference of $x$ and $y$.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Definition}.  A lattice $L$ with the least element $0$ satisfying either of the two equivalent conditions above is called a \emph{sectionally complemented lattice}.

Every relatively complemented lattice is sectionally complemented.  Every sectionally complemented distributive lattice is relatively complemented.

Dually, one defines a \emph{dually sectionally complemented lattice} to be a lattice $L$ with the top element $1$ such that for every $a\in L$, the interval $[a,1]$ is complemented, or, equivalently, the lattice dual $L^{\partial}$ is sectionally complemented.
